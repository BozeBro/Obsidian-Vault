Review PnC with group (Don't Work on it!!!!)

## Reflections on Yesterday
Yesterday, I spent too much time working on PnC and PnC OH, I should I have spent more time learning about Malloc ( and potentially starting the heap checker), and I barely did anything for 17355 which I definitely shoud have. 
## Goals for Today
1. ~~Focus on 17355 first and read the textbook~~
2. ~~Focus on 15213~~
3. PnC should not be thought about
4. Take some time to learn about Neovim again (surround, Might be useful tbh)
5. Take a walk??
