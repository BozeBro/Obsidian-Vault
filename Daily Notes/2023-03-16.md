### Reflections
Accidently, deleted all my config files so I have to restart. Luckily, my neovim is backed up. Couldn't resist doing PNC and meeting up with Weina to talk about it. Got GetCtx done as hoped for but stuck on interprocedural analysis. Idk how to start on Malloc Lab yet, still trying to figure out the slides. I have a decent idea, but I don't exactly know where to start is the problem. Getting a real hand on probability and relaxed with pizza. I got Obsidian to finally sync to iphone and ipad, so now I can finally start moving my collanotes onto PC and viewing them on the phone and ipad much better. We'll see if there is actually any improvement rn but we'll see. 
### TODO
1. Go to OH for 17355, and see where my errors are for interprocedural
2. Try to start heap checker, and potential a grip on explicit?
3. Think about housing
4. Review PnC with Big Boss Group
5. Grocery shopping
### Improvements
Couldn't resist PnC, it really do be sucking my soul. I should take more time to do more personal things since more work actually doesn't seem to affect any output. I think I am just occupying myself half the time with tasks I do not want to do. 
### Goals
Review notes for 17355 to stay on track. Make sure to upload notes into obsidian by the end of today. Attend 15213 lecture because it is getting hard.
Be a good boyfriend. Listen to some Abba. Stay positive.
