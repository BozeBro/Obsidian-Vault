Think about switching from InfoSec & Economy to Infrastructure and Economy. I feel there's just more room to grow in infrastructure, and InfoSec is farther from the money than swe is. Some thoughts to think about. I was thinking again about #programming-ideas and what to build. Maybe I should go back to the leetcode grind and relearn some distributed fundamentals and read and document some code bases. I should probaby go ahead and figure out that neovim-surround idea, where if I press Enter, it will keep the surroundings with me. I can't foget that I have homework due at mignight tonight for attendance.
