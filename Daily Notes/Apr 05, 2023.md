I'm very tired today. It's almost 2:30 in the morning and I just finished my #17335 homework. I got flamed since I basically outted myself to the marlon and Yara again. I really shouldn't be outting myself and allowing myself to be bullied, no need for it. I still gotta do my little reading for #game-dev But the issue is that I already know most of it already so its kinda hard to force myself to reread the stuff I already know, but I guess I'll put into my second brain. Meeting with the Jump lady is today in the noon time. I want to actually finish reading for 15213, do some PnC, figure out the research topic for 17355, and study a bit for 17355. I am so tired.
