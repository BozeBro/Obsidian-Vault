Feeling pretty unmotivated about doing work right now. Saturday, and I have to do some review for PnC to learn what was happening in the past 2 weeks. I have to do the same for 15213. Project is starting to come up in 17355 and homework is due for z3 which should be a little interesting. I'm just a little burned out atm.
