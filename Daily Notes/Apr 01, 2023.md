Feeling pretty unmotivated about doing work right now. Saturday, and I have to do some review for PnC to learn what was happening in the past 2 weeks. I have to do the same for 15213. Project is starting to come up in 17355 and homework is due for z3 which should be a little interesting. I'm just a little burned out atm.
Thinking about writing a chat server in c++ and scaling it up as a fun little thing to do and learn the low level details since I am bored rn. I might have to rebuild my website so it actually looks nice.
