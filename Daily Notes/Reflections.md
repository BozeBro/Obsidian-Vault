Marlon is going crazy for Emily. I'm working on my neovim config as always but its been making its slow progress. I want to add a little plugin such that when I am in a table, or some sort of surrounding, I can exit it, and enter into the same surrouding, maybe with a comma for tables. it would be handy for lists and stuff.
I also want to add more shortcuts  and stuff for my latex setup. 17355 is confusing as always. My grades a staircase from C to A which is fine. I feel stuck. I have many thoughts but I can't execute on them. I thimk this is the reason why I think a lot but get not as much work done in return. I need to force myself to do things
