#SUHA
#Hashing
each key has probability $\frac{1}{n}$ of mapping to any of $n$ buckets. Hashing of keys are independent 
$$
\mathbb{P} \left\{ h(k_{1}) = b_{1}\; \& \; \dots \; \& \; h(k_{i})=b_{i} \right\} = \frac{1}{n^{i}}
$$
With SUHA, Expected number of keys in any bucket is $\frac{m}{n} = \alpha$
