Let S denote the length of the smallest interval. 
Then, $S \leqslant \frac{1}{3}$
Let $0 \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{1}{3}$
Our strategy is to find $\mathbb{P}\left\{ S > x \right\}$ and then integrate the quantity to get the expectation.

It helps to consider the interval $I = [x, 1 -x]$, which has length $m = 1-2x$
