Remember the [[tail]]. Tail allows us to bound the percentage of a job. Say we want less than 1% of computer jobs to fail. Then we want to bound the [[tail]] to be less than 1%
A #Tail-Bound is just the upper bound on what the tail can be.
When examining the odds of exceeding the mean, or 
$$
\mathbb{P} \left\{ \mid X - \mu \mid \geqslant k \right\} ,\; \mu = \mathbb{E}\left[ X \right] 
$$
Where this is the concentration bound or concentration inequality. 

We will need past [[inequalities]]
[[Markov's Inequality]] 
[[Chebyshev's Inequality]]
[[Chernoff Bound]]
and some more
