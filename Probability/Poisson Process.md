[[Poisson]]
An arrival in an interval in a Poisson Process is distributed with a [[Uniform]] distribution.
Inter-time arrival time is distributed [[Exponential]]


#Theorem12-5 Given that one event of a Poisson process has occurred by time t, that event is equally likely to have occurred anywhere in $\left[ 0,t \right]$
a.k.a Number of arrivals per [[Uniform]] time period is [[Poisson]]
[[Theorem 12.5 Proof]]
