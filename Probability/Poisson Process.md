Merging indpt Poisson Processes
Given a poisson process with rate $\lambda_{1}$ and another with rate $\lambda_{2}$, the merge is a Poisson Process with rate $\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2}$
[[Poisson Merging Proof]]

Poisson Splitting
In a process. We mark events as either type A w.p. o and type B w.p. 1-p.

Then, type A events form Poisson process with rate $p\lambda$ and B events likewise with rate $(1-p)\lambda$
