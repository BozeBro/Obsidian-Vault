[[Chernoff Bound]]
[[Markov's Inequality]]
[[Chebyshev's Inequality]]
[[Sometimes Stronger Chernoff]]
[[Chernoff Poisson]]
[[Chernoff Binomial]]
[[Hoeffding's Inequality]]

We can also approximate using [[CLT Theorem]]
When upperbound the [[tail]] remember the tail is 
$$
\mathbb{P} \left\{ X \geqslant a \right\} 
$$
