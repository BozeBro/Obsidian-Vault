This is the weighted average of all possible values of a [[Random Variable]]
$$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\cdot f_X(x)\;dx$$
Think of expectation as the the sum of all possible outcomes multiplied by its probability value. 
We can also calculate Expectation using the tail
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ X \right] = \int \mathbb{P}(X > x) \, dx \\
$$
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ X \right] = \sum \mathbb{P}(X > x)\\
$$
