Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Standard leetcode question. I happened to learn some time ago that this problem is an irregular grammar, meaning you cannot make a regex to solve the problem for us.
