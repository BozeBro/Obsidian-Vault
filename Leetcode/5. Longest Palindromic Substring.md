Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Standard leetcode question. I happened to learn some time ago that this problem is an irregular grammar, meaning you cannot make a regex to solve the problem for us. 

```python
class Solution:

def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:

palindromes = [[False for _ in s] for _ in s]

best = 0

string = ""

for row in range(len(s)):

for beg in range(len(s) - row):

if row == 0:

palindromes[row][beg] = True

best = max(best, 1)

string = s[beg]

else:

end = beg + row

if s[beg] == s[end] and (palindromes[row - 2][beg + 1] or beg + 1 == end):

palindromes[row][beg] = True

best = max(best, row + 1)

string = s[beg:end+1]

return string
```
Standard DP type problem, where if we are looking at two characters in a string, just see if inner substring is also a palindrome.
```python
class Solution:

def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:

lbeg, lend = 0 , 0

for i, c in enumerate(s):

left = i

right = i

while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[right] == s[left]:

right += 1

left -= 1

if right - left - 2 > lend - lbeg:

lbeg = left + 1

lend = right - 1

left = i

right = i + 1

while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[right] == s[left]:

right += 1

left -= 1

if right - left - 2 > lend - lbeg:

lbeg = left + 1

lend = right - 1

return s[lbeg : lend + 1]
```
